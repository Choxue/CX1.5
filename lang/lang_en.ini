His story sparked our motivation and painted the possibilities and vision of what sport education could mean and lead to for our students across Greater China, if the right infrastructure is established. <br><br>CHOXUE’s vision was clarified and boosted by a number of members from Big Family House Church in Taipei, Taiwan beginning on March 2013, and the founding team came together gradually since October 2014 over a small 11 ping apartment. CHOXUE (CX) started as a small project that aims to documents all student-athletes’ performance via video and statistics and have evolved into a vision and mission"
